## Course Information

Introduction to Programming in Python is intended for students with
little or no programming experience.

It aims to provide students with an basic understanding of the Python
and its applications.

<< The class will use the Python 3.x programming language. >>

# Goals

- Provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems
- Help students, feel confident of their ability to write small programs
- Position students so that they can compete for research projects and internships
- Learning how to program in Python and how to solve problems with it
- Learning how to act as a team
- Having fun and programming contests
- Asking questions and learning from each other

## Lecture and Recitation Attendance

A significant portion of the material for this course will presented
only in lecture, so students are expected to regularly attend lectures.

Recitations give students a chance to ask questions about the lecture
material or the problem set for the given week. Sometimes, new material
may be covered in recitation. Recitation attendance is encouraged.

---

## Problem Sets and Quizzes

Each problem set will involve programming in Python. There will be 6-10
problem sets in the course. There will be two quizzes. All quizzes will
be closed-book, though you will be allowed to bring one page of notes to
the first quiz and two pages of notes to the second quiz.

> Pages must be letter-sized, double-sided, either handwritten or typed.

## Grading Policy

Grades will be roughly computed as follows:

| ACTIVITIES                               | PERCENTAGE |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Attendance                               | 10% - 0.5  |
| Problem Sets                             | 30% - 1.5  |
| Completion of mandatory finger exercises | Bonus 10%  |
| Quizzes                                  | 20% - 1    |
| Final Project                            | 40% - 2    |
| Total                                    | 100% - 5   |

---

## Grading Policy

Problem sets will be graded out of 10 points. Submissions that do not
run will receive at most 20% of the points. Please contact me via
`@feriun` if you have a problem understanding your problem set grade.

> Note: Quizzes and finger exercises are not available on course-ware.

## Academic Honesty

All universities has a policy on academic honesty. Students are expected
to be familiar with the policy and to abide by it. Violations will be
dealt with according to the policy.

---

## Extension and Dropping Problem Sets Policy

I do not grant any extensions. Instead, I offer late days and the option
of rolling at most 2 problem set grades into the final quiz score.

---

## Late Days

At the beginning of the term, students are given two late days that they
can use on problem sets. Starting with Problem Set 1, additional late
days can be accumulated for each assignment, one late day for each day
the assignment is turned in ahead of the deadline. Up to three late days
may be accumulated in this fashion in this course, i.e you can only have
a maximum of 3 late days at any point in time. Late days are discrete (a
student cannot use half a late day). The staff will keep track of late
days and feedback for each problem set will include the number of late
days the student has remaining. Any additional late work beyond these
late days will not be accepted. To avoid surprises, I suggest that
after you submit your problem set, you double check to make sure the
submission was uploaded correctly.

---

## Rolling Over Problem Sets

Before the final quiz, I will send out an announcement in which you can
choose at most 2 problem sets that you can drop. If dropped, the percent
that the problem sets are worth will be rolled into the final project
score.

Your best strategy is to do the problem sets early before work starts to
pile up.
